# An app that will help automate the writing of student feedback adhering to 
    #formatting requirements. 

    #reqs:
        #- The feedback must be written to a .txt file with the file name 
         #   including the students name. 
        #- The text in the file must have the headers 'General comments', 
         #   'Punctuality and engagement' and 'further learning'. Each header will have
          #  a short paragraph of text.
        #- All files to be written to a sub-folder named "feedback_files"
        #- The file should open automatically in a text editor for manual review.
        #- The user of the app should input students names.
        #- Inputs for marks/grades students recieve for specific factors such    
        #    as 'understanding_level', 'contribution_level' etc. 
        #- The marks should be used to format believable sentances to be written 
        #    to the file.
        #- The feedback is expected to have correct grammar and appear to be 
        #    written personally.
